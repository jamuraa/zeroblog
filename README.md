# Zero Blog

This is mostly a learning zone for Marie Janssen to play around and try to figure out how to do web things in Rust.

She got tired of not blogging and having her site just languish and wanted to use Rust more.

She also had some ideas about nifty features that would be cool for a blog.

Expect some random things.

## Planned minimal featuress

- A blog front page with some short descriptions of the latest articles.  Possibly the most recent thing or a "pinned" thing that has a short.
- Writing interface with a form to add tags to the post 
   - ideally two-pane with preview of the rendered text on the right, if not in the same method.
- Articles which have:
  - Title
  - Date (not necessarily now)
  - Tags
  - Short text for the front (with a default?) that is separate from the full article
- Ability to upload images for placement within posts (just show me the url it's at and let me)
- Ability to edit posts.  
  - new versions of an article supercede the old one and the old one may or may not be accessible 
    (based on choice of the author)
- A way to associate icons or something with tags.

## Maybe-could-be-fun features

- Custom layouts for posts in specific tags
- Series, linked with "Next article in series" and "Previous article in series" links
